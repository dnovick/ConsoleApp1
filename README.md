# ConsoleApp1
Demo console application for Baruch's C# studies.

Baruch, my 12 year old son is learning C#. He started doing this so he could create mods for one of his games. 
However, he has a real interest in learning how to develop software. This will be a great addition to
his electronics studies which continue to evolve.
